    "text": "About Me\nHi there! I’m Diana Orazbek — welcome to my little corner of the internet 🌸\nI’m currently pursuing my MBA at University Canada West in Vancouver, building on more than five years of experience in project coordination, business development, and financial operations. From airports and hospitals to telecom and real estate, I’ve worked across industries where people and precision go hand-in-hand.\nBut beyond my career, there’s more that defines me.\nI’m originally from Kazakhstan, now living in beautiful British Columbia, raising my sweet and curious son, Alan. Being a mom has taught me more about multitasking, resilience, and love than any course or job ever could. I also have a soft spot for flowers. I enjoy making floral arrangements and I hope to open my own flower shop one day which will be a cozy place filled with colors, scents and life. Maybe somewhere with a little coffee corner and lots of sun.\nWhen I am not studying or working, I am usually with Alan, planning something creative, or unwinding with a warm drink and fresh blooms nearby. I believe in beauty, balance, and building a life you love one thoughtful step at a time.\nThanks for visiting 💐"
