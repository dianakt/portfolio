 Commentary on Revisions

The LLM provided an organized professional structure which included all necessary components for an MBA student portfolio. I modified the original structure to match my personal story and my distinct career path.

I changed the title of the "Introduction" section to Professional Snapshot to better represent my professional identity and emphasize my dual focus on finance and project management.

I added a Leadership Philosophy section because I wanted to share how my multicultural heritage, together with my professional principles, shape my teamwork methods and decision-making approach.

I merged Certifications with Skills since I currently hold one certification; the combined format makes the presentation more compact and streamlined.

I enriched the Professional Experience section with detailed bullet points highlighting both my actions (e.g., improved invoice processing time by 20%) and acquired knowledge (e.g., learned ERP implementation basics). This connects my accounts payable background to core project management abilities.

While the LLM’s sample text served as a useful starting point, I rewrote most sentences in my own voice to ensure authenticity, smooth flow, and alignment with my writing style.
